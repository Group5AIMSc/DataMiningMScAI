# Data Mining Project: NYC Taxi Dataset

This repository contains our ongoing **Data Mining course project**, focused on analyzing the NYC Yellow Taxi trip dataset (October 2023). 

## Purpose
- To explore and clean a large real-world dataset (~3.5M rows).
- To track progress and showcase project steps, including:
  - Data uploading and inspection
  - Handling missing values and zeros
  - Cleaning critical columns (`trip_distance`, `fare_amount`, `total_amount`)
  - Saving a cleaned version ready for analysis

## Repository Structure
- `data/` → contains original and cleaned datasets
- `notebooks/` → Jupyter/Colab notebooks for cleaning and exploration
- `scripts/` → Python scripts used in the project
- `README.md` → project description and progress

## Next Steps
- Feature engineering
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model building and evaluation
